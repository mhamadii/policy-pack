# Policy Pack â€” Incident Response Plan & Acceptable Use Policy  

This project demonstrates the ability to write and structure real-world security policies aligned with industry frameworks (NIST CSF, ISO 27001).  

It includes:  
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP):** step-by-step guidance for handling security incidents.  
- **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** defines rules and responsibilities for employees when using company IT assets.  

The goal is to showcase **policy development, compliance alignment, and documentation skills** for a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) role.
